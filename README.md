This is the repo for the Review of Assorted Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Parking Space Occupancy Detection. In it, you'll find various `.ipynb` files, each named to represent the model that is created, trained, and evaluated by said file.

## Environment Setup

The `EnvironmentDetails` diretory contains the `environment.yml` and `requirements.txt` files, which can be used to instantiate a copy of our Conda and Pip states, respectively, though we note that these files are more tailored for Windows environments and may not fully support Linux environments.

## Model Architectures and Various Utility Functionalities

The `utils.py` file contains some common utility functionalities shared by the `.ipynb` files, as well as the specifics of the model architecture and design for every model evaluated.

## Dataset Acquisition

Our work used two datasets: [CNRPark+EXT](http://cnrpark.it/) and [PKLot](https://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/databases/parking-lot-database/). To use this data, create a `Data` directory locally and downlaod the datasets to that directory.
